# Sales Predictive Model

## Project Objectives

Develop a predictive model to forecast sales based on the floating price.

## Tasks
- Data preprocessing;
- Exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and trends;
- Feature engineering to extract relevant features for forecasting;
- Model selection and training using appropriate techniques;
- Evaluation of model performance and fine-tuning for better results.

## Conclusion

The final predictive model achieved satisfactory performance metrics (R2: 0.67).
